Python Wrapper for the pixel art scaling code in "gimp-plugin-pixel-art-scalers"

I needed to apply hqx scaling to lots of files and didn't find a good library that handles it and is still maintained. 
https://github.com/bbbbbr/gimp-plugin-pixel-art-scalers
Contains a good implementation, so this provides a python wrapper.
